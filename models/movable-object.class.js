 * Properties:
 * - speed: The horizontal speed of the object.
 * - otherDirection: Flag indicating whether the object is moving in the opposite direction.
 * - speedY: The vertical speed of the object, used for jumping or gravity effects.
 * - acceleration: The acceleration rate of the object, affecting its speedY during gravity application.
 * - energy: The energy level of the object, used to determine its health status.
 * - lastHit: Timestamp of the last time the object was hit.
 * - jumpSound: Audio object for playing jump sound.
 * - intervalIds: Array of interval IDs for stoppable intervals.
 * - applyGravityINT: Interval ID for the gravity application.
